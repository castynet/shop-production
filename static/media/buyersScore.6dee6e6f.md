# How we Calculate the Buyer's Score

> As of now the buyers score is very subjective, we are working on making it a little more objective but as of now here is how it works.

Each Product is judged on the following criteria;

1. **Value** - for the price how good is the product
2. **Reparability** - ease & price to get the item repaired.
3. **Longevity** - product's expected lifetime & how well it ages.

For each of these the product gets a score out of 10, then gets a buyer's score from the average.
